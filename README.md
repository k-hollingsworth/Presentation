# Presentation
Presentation created analyzing attendance at Broadways musicals and plays from January-August 2016

This data set is comprised of data collected weekly from January to August 2016 on Broadway shows. There were 995 observations of 14 variables, including date, show name, show theater, gross revenue of the show, attendance statistics, number of performances, and performance type (either Musical or Play).

I hypothesized that musicals were more well attended than plays on Broadway.

My approach was to plot the musicals and plays on top of each other and then render two separate plots to asses the discrepancies. This resulted in a clear win by musicals. This could also be due to the longer runs and more productions per day but would be an area for future consideration.
